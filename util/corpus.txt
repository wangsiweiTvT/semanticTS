For discretization, first outliers are detected using Inter Quartile Range (IQR) . After setting the outliers aside,
values are binned (discretized) by equal-width bins. Both outlier detection and the binning are based on the entire
dataset, as opposed to each time series independently. Binning the values based on the entire data helps better
capture the differences between series. For example if the data is coming from two participants with different
levels of physical activity, the discretized data should reflect that (In this case the less active participant will not
observe a subset of the symbols that correspond to high levels of activity).
